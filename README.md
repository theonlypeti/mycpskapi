# MyCpSkAPI

MyCpSkAPI (name pending haha) is a Python-based application that interacts with the cp.sk website
to fetch and display train route information. It provides detailed information about train routes including
departure and arrival times, delays and much more.

## Features

- Fetches train route information from cp.sk.
- Detailed information about each route including delays, 
train types, duration, distances, remarks, warnings and rolling stock specs.
- Can be used from command line or as a standalone module.
- Includes autocorrect and search for station names.
- Outputs itinerary information in JSON format.

## Requirements

- Python
- pip

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using cd (or just open cmd in there).
3. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

You can run the program with command-line arguments. Here's an example:

```bash
python main.py --depart "Bratislava" --to "Podhajska" --date 13.05.2025 --time 12:00 --autocorrect
```

## Command-line Arguments

- `--depart`: The departure city (required).
- `--to`: The destination city (required).
- `--date`: The date of departure in the format dd.mm.yyyy.
- `--time`: The time of departure in the format hh:mm.
- `--force`: Forces the program to use the exact station names provided by the user, even if they contain potential typos or mismatches.
- `--autocorrect`: Enables the program to automatically correct the station names provided by the user, by guessing the most likely correct names.
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode.
- `--profiling`: Measures the runtime and outputs it to profile.prof.
- `--logfile`: Logs to a file.

## Using as a module

You can also use the program as a module in your own Python projects. Here's an example:

```python
from main import get_itinerary

itinerary = get_itinerary("Bratislava hl.st.", "Podh√°jska")
itinerary.pprint()
print(itinerary.distance)
```

We are preparing to share this project on PyPI, so you will be able to install it using pip and import it from anywhere using its module name.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Cities and stations are stored in the `stations.json` file. This list very likely might be outdated and incomplete.
If you would like to add a missing station, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Name ideas also welcome lol.
